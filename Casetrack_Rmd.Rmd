## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Require Casetrack source file}
require("Casetrack_R.R")

```


```{r Selecting all data from Casetrack Table}
myQuery = "SELECT * from `Casetrack`;"
dat = dbGetQuery(dbConn, myQuery)
data.frame(dat)

summary(dat)

```


```{r Find Crimes by Keywords}
comments = dat$Comments

type = c("mj", "stab", "gun")
amount[1] = sum(table(grep("marijuana|pot", comments)))
amount[2] = sum(table(grep("stab|knife", comments)))
amount[3] = sum(table(grep("shot|shoot|gun", comments)))

crime.type = data.frame(type, amount)

```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
